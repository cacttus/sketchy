We are not using the create-raect-app thing so no react-scripts are used
instead we are using webpack manually to compile typescript and then electron-forge to bundle electron into an exe
We bundle everything with webpack which, of course, uses ts-loader (i.e. tsc) to compile the typescript tsx files.
WP bundles it all into /dist  NOTE the webpack config file defines development or production - this will determine if code is minified.
Electron uses the package.json 's main configuration to locate the bundle we compiled with webpack.
It simply encloses it in the electron container and we're good to go - for dev.
For release builds electron-forge uses the same to push everything into a .deb, or, .exe
